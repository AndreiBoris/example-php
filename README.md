# example-php

PHP classes I put together taken out of a slightly bigger application.

`EmailSubscriptionOntraport.php` is the main class to look at it. It extends `EmailSubscription.php` and uses `OntraportContact.php`. 

This code existed inside of a Lumen API application. Please refer to Lumen documentation for the packages from that framework that are used in these files.
